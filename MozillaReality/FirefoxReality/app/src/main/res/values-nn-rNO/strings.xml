    <!-- This string is used to label a text label for selecting the language in the 'Language' dialog window
         (accessible from the browser's Settings' dialog window). Below this string appears a list of locales for
         the user to choose as their preferred language for the browser's speech-to-text 'Voice Search' system.
         Based on the user's selection, the printed language is mapped to its ISO 639-1 code
         (e.g., `Español` is mapped to `es`) when configured in the 'Voice Search' system. -->
