# Android Cross-Product Localization Repository

This repository stores the unified English files from the Android projects participating, and the localized files for them.

Localization happens on [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/android-l10n/). Please get in touch with delphine (at) mozilla (dot) com directly for more information.

## String updates

Automation is used to extract daily new English strings from the code repositories. Itâ€™s possible to invoke [automation manually](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/actions) for each individual project.
